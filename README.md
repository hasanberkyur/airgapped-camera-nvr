# Air-Gapped Home Camera NVR

## Overview

This project documents the design, implementation, and verification of an air-gapped IP camera system using consumer hardware.
The goal was to build a camera setup that can be accessed locally and remotely without allowing the camera itself any internet access, and to verify this claim using packet-level analysis.

The project evolved iteratively as real-world constraints (hardware limitations, network topology, WAN restrictions) were discovered and addressed.
